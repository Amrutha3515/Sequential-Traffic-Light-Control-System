# VSDSquadron Mini 

<details>
<summary>Task-1</summary>

+ In this program we will be using **RISC-V GNU Compiler Toolchain** to compile our c programs into risc v instructions. 
+ Then we will be using **Iverilog** to compile & simulate our verilog files. 
+ We will be using **GTKwave** to view the relevant waveforms obtained from verilog simulation.
+ Also we will be using **Yosys** to synthesis our RTL.

# Compile a `c` Program Using Riscv Compiler


## Installing Leafpad Text Editor:


We will be using `leafpad` text editor to write our `c` program. The text editor can be installed as shown below (applicable for ubuntu 22.04 version).


```
sudo snap install leafpad 
```
## The Program:

Navigate to the home directory and create a new `.c` file in leafpad as shown below,

```
 cd 
 leafpad sum1ton.c &
```
write a `c program` and use the `save button`or use `ctrl + s`  to save the file. 

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    int sum = 0, i, n = 5;
    for (i=1; i<=n; ++i){
        sum += i;
    }
    printf("Sum of numbers from 1 to %d is %d \n", n, sum);
    return 0;
}

```

## Compilation & Execution


Compile and run the program as below

```
 gcc program_name.c 
 ./a.out 
```
in my case it is sum1ton.c
![9](https://github.com/Amrutha3515/vsdmini/assets/150571663/970bafec-bd71-4319-8cd2-d82b524bd43a)

To view the code you have written and compile the program in riscv gcc compiler follow the below instruction.

```
cat program_name.c
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o program_name.o program_name.c
```
in my case it is sum1ton.o sum1ton.c

![14](https://github.com/Amrutha3515/vsdmini/assets/150571663/5120c785-1a2b-46ad-b493-d79e0d6a3f45)

Now open a new tab in terminal using `ctrl + shift + T` and follow below instruction to open the assembly code for the c program we had executed earlier.

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d program_name.o
```
to search for `main()` section of our program below the below step,

```
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d program_name.o | less
: /main
```

press `n` key to scrolldown & press `q` to quit.

![t-1](https://github.com/Amrutha3515/vsdmini/assets/150571663/dbfee5f1-1518-4b72-94e0-233e53a7176c)

The above image shows the `main()` section of my program. And as we can see there are 15 instructions in the `main()`. Address of each instruction can be seen. The address of the next instruction is `current address + 4 bytes`. <br>
<br> 
**Total Number of Instructions = (Address of the first instruction of the next instruction block -  Address of the first instruction of the current instruction block) / 4**
<br>
<br>
Therefore, Total number of instructions in main() =  (101c0 - 10184)/4 = (3c/4)<sub>**16**</sub>=(F)<sub>**16**</sub> = (**15**)<sub>**10**</sub>


## Role of -O1 & -Ofast: 

**-O** is a flag which directs the compiler to what extent it needs to optimize a given program, the optimization may be in terms of reducing binary size of the program while compramizing of the speed of execution or optimize the speed of exceution while increasing the binary program size. There are various levels of optimization,
<br>
**-O1** : This flag offers basic optimization, balances binary code size as well as speed. <br>
**-Ofast** : This flag offers aggressive optimizations. It prioritizes speed of execution over the size of compiled binary program size. <br>

Let us compile the same program with **-Ofast** flag.


```
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o program_name.o program_name.c
# In a new terminal tab
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d program_name.o | less
: /main
```
![t](https://github.com/Amrutha3515/vsdmini/assets/150571663/a39fcea4-6911-48e9-9acb-e50e19db3a6c)

The above image shows the `main()` section of my program. And as we can see there are 12 instructions in the `main()`. Address of each instruction can be seen. The address of the next instruction is `current address + 4 bytes`. <br>
<br> 
**Total Number of Instructions = (Address of the first instruction of the next instruction block -  Address of the first instruction of the current instruction block) / 4**
<br>
<br>
Therefore, Total number of instructions in main() =  (101e0 - 101bo)/4 = (30/4)<sub>**16**</sub>=(C)<sub>**16**</sub> = (**12**)<sub>**10**</sub>

we can observe that the Number of instructions is reduced with -Ofast

 <summary>Task-2</summary>

 As my project is Traffic Flow Controller: Sequential Traffic Light Control System.
 Assuming we have two directions (North-South and East-West) with three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) for each direction.
 The sample C code for this project is 
 ```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h> // for sleep function

// Define the traffic light states
typedef enum {
    RED,
    GREEN,
    YELLOW
} TrafficLightState;

// Define the directions
typedef enum {
    NS,  // North-South
    EW   // East-West
} Direction;

// Structure to represent a traffic light for a direction
typedef struct {
    TrafficLightState state;
    Direction direction;
} TrafficLight;

// Function to display the current state of the traffic light
void displayLight(TrafficLight *light) {
    const char *dir = (light->direction == NS) ? "North-South" : "East-West";
    switch (light->state) {
        case RED:
            printf("%s Direction: Red Light\n", dir);
            break;
        case GREEN:
            printf("%s Direction: Green Light\n", dir);
            break;
        case YELLOW:
            printf("%s Direction: Yellow Light\n", dir);
            break;
    }
}

int main() {
    TrafficLight nsLight = {RED, NS}; // North-South traffic light
    TrafficLight ewLight = {GREEN, EW}; // East-West traffic light

    while (1) {
        displayLight(&nsLight);
        displayLight(&ewLight);

        // Control the North-South traffic light
        switch (nsLight.state) {
            case RED:
                sleep(15);  // Red light for 15 seconds
                nsLight.state = GREEN;
                ewLight.state = RED;
                break;
            case GREEN:
                sleep(10);  // Green light for 10 seconds
                nsLight.state = YELLOW;
                break;
            case YELLOW:
                sleep(5);  // Yellow light for 5 seconds
                nsLight.state = RED;
                ewLight.state = GREEN;
                break;
        }

        // Control the East-West traffic light
        switch (ewLight.state) {
            case RED:
                // Red light duration is managed by North-South traffic light
                break;
            case GREEN:
                sleep(10);  // Green light for 10 seconds
                ewLight.state = YELLOW;
                break;
            case YELLOW:
                sleep(5);  // Yellow light for 5 seconds
                ewLight.state = RED;
                nsLight.state = GREEN;
                break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

```
To complie this code with RISC-V GCC. we can use the following commands on the ubuntu terminal .

```
leafpad demo.c
```
in my case demo is my file name , we can use any other names as you want and write the code that suitable for your selected project and save the file.

![VirtualBox_vsdmini_23_06_2024_20_54_14](https://github.com/Amrutha3515/vsdmini/assets/150571663/cb999ca8-9e44-4a9a-b23f-b2638d063c8e)
![VirtualBox_vsdmini_23_06_2024_20_53_42](https://github.com/Amrutha3515/vsdmini/assets/150571663/e6e353b7-1055-4219-80a8-3d571fd25987)
To compile andview the output of the code use the command
```
gcc demo.c
./a.out
```
![VirtualBox_vsdmini_23_06_2024_22_07_49](https://github.com/Amrutha3515/vsdmini/assets/150571663/30e9e206-026c-45b0-9037-ab7c3510f3c7)

As I Mentioned in the code i gave the delay of 15 seconds to 5 seconds varying according to the colour of the light to change the state.

 

https://github.com/Amrutha3515/vsdmini/assets/150571663/4631c83b-d29a-410c-86f6-b619a27bd191

From the video we can see that the no colour matches in the two directions. if the North- south direction is Red then the east -west direction is green. <br>

similarly, if the North-south direction is green then the east-west direction is red.

From this we can control the traffic light how and when to change the state of light.
